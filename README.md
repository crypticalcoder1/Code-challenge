This repository contains solutions to three programming challenges implemented in JavaScript. Each challenge addresses a specific task related to computation and decision-making based on input values.

Challenges Overview
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Task: Implement a program that prompts the user to input student marks and then outputs the corresponding grade based on predefined criteria.

Criteria:

A: > 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: less than 40
Usage:

Open student_grade_generator.js in any JavaScript environment.
Follow the prompts to input student marks.
The program will output the corresponding grade based on the input marks.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Task: Create a program that takes the speed of a car as input and determines if it's within the speed limit. If not, calculate demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the limit.

Criteria:

Speed <= 70 km/h: "Ok"
For every 5 km/h above 70 km/h, award 1 demerit point.
Usage:

Open speed_detector.js in any JavaScript environment.
Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
The program will output either "Ok" or the total demerit points based on the speed entered.
Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Task: Implement a program that calculates an individualâ€™s net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. The program should compute deductions for PAYE (Income Tax), NHIF, and NSSF based on predefined rates.

Usage:

Open net_salary_calculator.js in any JavaScript environment.
Modify the basicSalary and benefits variables with your desired values.
Run the program to calculate and display detailed salary components including gross salary, deductions (PAYE, NHIF, NSSF), and net salary.
